			<div class="panel-body">
        <p>USAV is the governing body of New England club volleyball. The membership fee is comprised of USA Volleyball membership ($22.50) and Regional Membership ($22.50). This covers everything from National teams to player insurance on the regional and national level. On the Regional level the fee goes to programming and development of coaches and players. Our region does not have an office or paid staff so the fees go back to programming for the sport.</p>

        <p>Starting with our 2014 season you must pay online when you register or re-register your USAV membership. Pumas will not pay your USAV membership and no player will be allowed to tryout without their current USAV card.</p>

        <h4>Instructions</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>You will need a parent or guardian with you, to provide a driver's license or state ID number. This is used instead of a parent's signature on paper.</li>
          <li>You will need a credit card to pay online.</li>
          <li>Proceed to section A or B below.</li>
