				<p>Pumas believe that the ideal experience for the athlete, and the club, is for the athlete to play at their appropriate age group. Refer to the <a href="/club-faq" routerLink="/club-faq">Frequently Asked Questions</a> for a discussion on playing-up an age group and <a href="/tryouts-guidelines" routerLink="/tryouts-guidelines">Tryout Guidelines</a> for a guide to skill and experience levels for each division and age group.</p>

				<p>Players are strongly encouraged to plan on attending all appropriate tryout sessions, but must attend at least one. Comprehensive data is collected from each tryout and used to make final decisions on team placements and cuts. The tryouts are competitive, especially at the older divisions, and cuts will be made. See <a href="/club-faq" routerLink="/club-faq">FAQ</a> for missing a tryout date.
				</p>

				<p>Any athlete who does not make an Open team will be considered for the Club division automatically at no additional fee. Refer to the <a href="/schedule-tryouts" routerLink="/schedule-tryouts">Tryout Schedule</a> to determine times and locations of the tryouts for your age group and selected division. Refer to <a href="/club-faq" routerLink="/club-faq">Frequently Asked Questions</a> for a discussion on playing-up.</p>

				<p>There are several important steps you must follow to ensure you are ready to tryout and become a player on a Pumas volleyball team.</p>
