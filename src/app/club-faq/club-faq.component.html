                        <p>Many factors go into the decision of how to make teams.

We also use coaches evaluations from prior years, and of course we have to consider the positions the girls want to play and are good at. After the tryouts end, the coaches meet for many hours to discuss the player ratings and form teams. In the largest age divisions we create AA, A, B, and C levels so that a girl's teammates are of similar strength.

                        <p>Our top priority is to provide the best possible experience for all players. We rate players and put them on teams based on their level of play and their position, not on their geographic location or school. We recognize that carpooling is important to many families, but our primary goal is to make the strongest team at each level. After teams are built but before they are finalized, we do look to see if there are any possible trades that could put girls from the same town together to facilitate carpooling, but only within the same level and only if it doesn't compromise either team's positional makeup. A parent from both players must request this prior to team selection.</p>

                        <p>If a parent requests for two players to be on the same team together there are additional requirements. The higher rated player (from tryouts) will be placed on the lower rated players team. Pumas will send you an additional questionnaire to answer what you would like to happen in all circumstances (one player does not make it etc..).</p>

                        <p>One of the benefits of club volleyball is its ability to make new friendships, and this philosophy has worked extremely well for us toward that goal.</p>

                        <p>This is a controversial issue in club volleyball. First, many parents (understandably) have a higher regard for their daughter's skills than the coaches. Second, many parents and high school coaches believe that their daughters will improve quicker by playing on a higher level team. This is not necessarily true. The girls want and need play-time, and a girl playing over her head as the weakest player on a team will sit on the bench a lot and will likely have a lower self-image than one who plays at her skill level. Girls who are among the strongest on their team can also excel in leadership skills. The ideal team is one which has no weakest nor strongest player, but where every girl has a role to play and feels important. That's what we strive for at Pumas. </p>

                        <p>Practice times for both the Open and Club division are decided in mid-December after the teams are made. When every team is formed we use the practice availability information that you entered in your registration. We do this so everyone on the team will be able to practice together. We then look to place each team at one of our 7 practice facilities. At this time players may be changed from one team to another (same age and level) to allow all teams to practice together. Once this is finished and double checked we announce the teams practice times on the web site.</p> 

                        <p>Throughout the season your team may have some practice time or location changes due to weather and court availability. Not every facility allows us full access all season.

However, technically you only need to be at one of them. The major disadvantage at missing a tryout date is that we will have incomplete data to use as a comparison with all attendees (at that age group and level). Also, we do not have players tryout outside of their age group if they have a scheduling conflict. This distorts the data collected on that player, as well as any other player they are interacting with. To make the best informed choices we can for our team building we would love to have as much data as possible.

                        <p>On any tournament date, there are over 30 tournaments happening at sites all over New England, with about 300 teams participating. Each tournament is confined to one age division, and could have anywhere from one to five courts, with typically four teams per court. In a season, each club is required to host the same number of tournament courts as they have teams. For example, a club with 10 teams might host two courts on each of five tournament dates. The NERVA coordinator uses many factors to schedule the tournaments. Obviously, the team's rank is a primary factor, as most teams want to play against other teams of similar strength. The coordinator first decides what age tournament will be at each site, making sure that the host club has at least one team in that tournament. Teams are then assigned to that site based on ranking and geography. This can be a difficult balance, because some clubs are less willing to travel than others, even if it means playing against teams of very different strength. Suffice it to say, the coordinator's job is not an easy one. </p>

                        <p>NERVA includes teams from Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Maine. In a large division with 80+ teams, it's easier to schedule tournaments among equal strength teams that are fairly local to each team. But in a smaller division (such as 12U) there are fewer options. Being in Massachusetts, we've found that most tournaments are within one hour's drive, with two hours being the furthest, and sometimes they're at our home gym! </p>

                        <p>Tournaments last from 5-8 hours, depending on the success of your team. About half of that time is spent actually playing. A typical arrival time is 8-8:30AM. Most tournaments have two phases - a period of pool play followed by playoffs. The most common two-court tournament has four teams assigned to each court (pool). Each of these four teams play two games against each of the other three teams, for a total of six games. After this, the teams are ranked 1-4 based on won/loss record. The top two teams in each pool then move on to the playoff phase. Sometimes tiebreakers must be used and occasionally an extra game must be played between teams tied for 2nd, because a team can never be eliminated from playoffs based on points alone. In playoffs, the teams play a semifinal match across pools, and the winners meet in the finals.</p> 

                        <p>Tournaments with more or fewer pools are run slightly differently, but all eventually declare 1st and 2nd place finishers. </p>

                        <p>In general, the coaches referee the 12U division, and the girls referee the older divisions (club 14-18). In the Open level, there is a trained professional head ref, and the girls do the rest. There are two primary reasons why the girls do the refereeing. The first is monetary. The cost of paying for adult referees at each tournament would increase every club's fee. In addition it is believed that properly trained girls do an equivalently good job, and they gain valuable experience in the process. Sometimes this exposes the girls to criticism, and we have two opinions about this. To the parents, we ask you to be aware that the purpose of Junior Olympic Volleyball is to build self-esteem in all participants, and not to tear it down. <strong>Loud, obnoxious behavior will not be tolerated</strong> and you may be asked by the Tournament Director to leave the gym. To the girls, we say that the best way to keep the fans and coaches from complaining is to be prepared and pay attention. A mistaken call is soon forgotten, but a girl who doesn't know the rules or is habitually distracted while working is asking for trouble. The Pumas Volleyball Club holds clinics for refereeing and scorekeeping, and we expect the girls to attend and learn. </p>

                        <p>Each team is usually assigned one or two work (referee) assignments during tournament pool play. After pool play, a team not making playoffs may be asked to work the first playoff round. Similarly, a team losing a playoff round may be asked to work the next round.</p> 

                        <p>The work team is composed of a head referee (R1), and second referee (R2), two line judges (L1, L2), and two or three scorekeepers (S1, S2, S3). The referees have whistles, the line judges either have flags or use hand signals, and the scorekeepers sit at the desk with pencils, scorecards, and the scoreboard. R1 is the head ref, and usually stands up on a platform. She begins and ends play, makes ball-handling calls that she sees, and oversees the rest of the work team. R2 stands on the floor at the opposite end of the net, and focuses on net and centerline violations. She also controls player substitutions and timeouts. L1 and L2 each control two lines. They look for serving foot-faults, balls landing in or out with respect to their lines, and balls touched by blockers that the referees may have trouble seeing. S1 keeps a paper copy of the scorecard, making notations for each point scored and keeping track of player substitutions and any illegal substitutions or rotations. S2 maintains the visible scoreboard and assists S1 with the busy task of keeping everything in order on paper. There is a Libero Tracking Sheet that also must be maintained, either by S2 or S3. </p>

                        <p>The process adapts slightly from year to year, but generally a team's ranking is based on how that team fares at each tournament, taking into account the level of the tournament. At the beginning of the season, the Pumas Volleyball Club staff will pre-rank each team AA, A, B, or C depending on its apparent strength. Each team will then play its first tournament against teams of similar strength. After that, a points system is maintained based on the position each team finishes in the tournament (considering the tournament level), and the team's ranking is a reflection of their point total. The better a team performs, the higher their rank and the tougher the competition is likely to be at the next tournament (for age divisions with multiple-tournaments). Sometimes point totals are published on the NERVA website, and sometimes only the team's rankings are posted. </p>

                        <p>The Open League was established to give the elite players from each club the opportunity to compete at the highest possible level. However, it's not a different league, it's simply the top ranked teams in each of the 14U, 16U, 17U, and 18U divisions at any given time. In theory, any team could get into the Open League if their ranking becomes high enough. Before the first Open League tournament, the teams who want to be in the Open League compete in a qualifying tournament to pre-rank which teams will comprise the Open League for the first tournament date. On each tournament date, the top ranked teams (depending on the number of courts available at the site) compete at the same site, sometimes a college gym, with professional NERVA refs. For this privilege, each attending club pays an additional site and referee fee. Some teams jump in and out of the Open League tournaments as their rankings change. If a team doesn't get into the Open League on a given date, it plays in the next highest rated tournament for that age division. Presumably, that is still against teams close to their ability level.</p> 

                        <p>Pumas has Open level teams whose goal is to compete in the Open League. Open teams (aka "power teams" or "travel teams"), because of their elite status, almost always practice more than once per week. Pumas Open teams usually have one additional mid-week evening practice and enter additional tournaments besides the standard five. This requires a higher fee from the team members than club teams. If a Pumas Open team doesn't play well enough to make or remain in the NERVA Open League, they will continue to be an Open team and attempt to win enough throughout the season to enter the Open League. </p>

                        <p>The short answer is yes, they might, and you may see some teams doing this. However, this is not the path to better volleyball and our coaches discourage this behavior. Volleyball is the ultimate team sport, and improvement and enjoyment come from playing together as a team. It requires much more skill to accurately pass the ball to your teammates than to pass it over the net, and over time developing this skill will lead to more victories. </p>

                        <p>We are not proponents of high school teams playing together through the club season. Some of the greatest benefits of playing on a club team (other than increasing your physical skill level) are:
                          <ul>
                            <li>The new friendships made in a sport they can play for the rest of their lives.</li>
                            <li>Learning to communicate and play with others they are not as familiar with. This is a skill that can transcend volleyball into many aspects of life.</li>
                            <li>Learning from a variety of coaches (over the years) will benefit the athlete both mentally and physically.</li>
                            <li>It strengthens the development of the individual players being exposed to a variety of coaching philosophies.</li>
                            <li>Playing with other players will give them different perspectives to playing the game. The game is 90% mental and learning to think and see the game from different views strengthens that athletes thought process.</li>
                            <li>Playing with different players will raise their individual overall skill level as they will not be leaning on or covering for HS teammates.</li>
                            <li>Every season the club teams change more dramatically than high school teams which leads to many new experiences for that athlete which helps them grow as an athlete and a person.</li>
                            <li>The best example of this is the US National teams players who play all over the world when not in an Olympic year. If playing together all the time was that great a benefit they would be together all year round.</li>

                          <li>Be prepared as they are an all-day event. The earliest you may leave is around 1:30 pm but plan on staying until the end, around 5:30 pm.</li>
                          <li>Parents are responsible for getting their child to and from all tournaments. We always encourage teammates to use carpooling whenever possible.</li>
                          <li>Bring a folding chair in case there are no bleachers or seats provided. There are some facilities that do not allow folding chairs in, so be prepared to leave it in the car if necessary.</li>
                          <li>You should pack your lunch/snacks for your daughter, there wonâ€™t be any time for the player to leave during the day. During NERVA tournaments they will have a limited time to eat lunch before they have to return to playing. If you are planning on getting something local you may have to miss some of their play time to have the food there in time for them to eat. Going to get food at the beginning of their break will too late for them to eat by the time you get back.</li>
                          <li>All players are required to stay until the end of the teams day, they must be released by the tournament director or their coach before leaving. This includes working the final match if that is what the team is supposed to do. If you must leave a tournament early you need to let your coach know 10 days before so any adjustments that need to be made in line-ups can be tried out in practice. Telling the coach you cannot stay after pool play is over (whether you are playing semi-final or not) and you have other things to do is extremely disrespectful to your team and your coach. Plan on staying until the tournament director (or your coach) releases the TEAM. If there was any possibility that you could have stayed to play then there is every possibility you can stay and work.</li>
                          <li>A typical NERVA one day tournament is 6 rounds of pool play and depending on how your team places in pool, playoffs. In Open competitions all teams stay for play-offs. In Club tournaments (AA/A/B/C) the top two teams from each pool makes play-offs with the third or fourth place team working that first semi-final round.</li>
                          <li>Each facility has their own set of rules that the participating teams must follow. Please be respectful of each individual facilities rules for chairs, food and beverages and yes, coffee is considered a beverage. The rules apply to everyone at the event (parents included). Clubs are renting these facilities according to rules the facilities desire. These facilities can decide to revoke rental at any time if the attendees are not following the â€˜house rulesâ€™.</li>
                          <li>All tournament site information and location can be found on the region site, under the schedules tab. The enter times listed are 30 minutes prior to start times. Some facilities are very restrictive and will not let you in before the posted enter time but most do. Check with your coach about what time they want the team to be there and ready on the court.</li>

                        <p>There are four primary sets of rules governing indoor volleyball in the USA:
                          <ul>
                            <li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.teamusa.org/USA-Volleyball/Education">USAV</a>, governing club volleyball including NERVA</li>

                            <li>NFSHSA, ("Federation") governing most high school volleyball outside of Massachusetts</li>

                        <p>The differences between these four are too numerous to list, but the most common differences are as follows. In NERVA (USAV):
                        <ul>
                          <li>Matches are usually 2 out of 3 games, played to 21 points instead of 3 out of 5 played to 25</li>
                          <li>The Libero cannot be court captain</li>
                          <li>Players cannot completely go over the centerline, even if there was no interference</li>
                          <li>It is allowed to touch the lower part of the net, but not the white tape at the top</li>
                          <li>Timeouts last just 30 seconds, not 60 seconds</li>
                          <li>There is a maximum of 12 substitutions per game instead of 15</li>

If the player misses a serve from the normal end line, she is allowed a second serve from five feet closer to the net. 12U players are generally not asked to referee unless they are comfortable doing so, and the scorekeeping is greatly simplified. All other age groups follow the standard rules. </p>

                        <p>Great question! In order to keep the duration of each tournament to a reasonable time, NERVA plays 21-point games instead of 25-point games. However, because the official USAV rules stipulate 25 as the game-ending score, it was thought better to play the 21 points from 4 to 25 rather than 0 to 21. In this way, a player or coach used to 25-point games could still view 25 as the game-ending score for strategic purposes, and wouldn't be caught by surprise.</p>

                        <p>With volleyballs, you generally get what you pay for. For regulation volleyballs, the best balls are made of leather, and these are generally the easiest on the arms. They cost $40-50. Next best is composite leather, which costs $25-35. They are a little harder on the arms but not too bad. We use composite balls for practices and leather balls for games. Most balls you get in backyard volleyball sets or at department stores are either rubber or some amazingly painful material, and will usually discourage the player.</p> 

                        <p>For younger or beginner players, a lighter ball is recommended. The lighter weight makes bumping, setting, and serving easier. We use the white Mikasa Trainer balls or the red, white, and blue Tachikara Volley Lite. They are in the $25-35 range. </p>
