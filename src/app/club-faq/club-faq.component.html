                        <p>Many factors go into the decision of how to make teams.

                        <p>Our top priority is to provide the best possible experience for all players. We rate players and put them on teams based on their level of play and their position, not on their geographic location or school. We recognize that carpooling is important to many families, but our primary goal is to make the strongest team at each level. After teams are built but before they are finalized, we do look to see if there are any possible trades that could put girls from the same town together to facilitate carpooling, but only within the same level and only if it doesn't compromise either team's positional makeup. A parent from both players must request this prior to team selection.</p>

                        <p>If a parent requests for two players to be on the same team together there are additional requirements. The higher rated player (from tryouts) will be placed on the lower rated players team. Pumas will send you an additional questionnaire to answer what you would like to happen in all circumstances (one player does not make it etc..).</p>

                        <p>One of the benefits of club volleyball is its ability to make new friendships, and this philosophy has worked extremely well for us toward that goal.</p>

                        <p>This is a controversial issue in club volleyball. First, many parents (understandably) have a higher regard for their daughter's skills than the coaches. Second, many parents and high school coaches believe that their daughters will improve quicker by playing on a higher level team. This is not necessarily true. The girls want and need play-time, and a girl playing over her head as the weakest player on a team will sit on the bench a lot and will likely have a lower self-image than one who plays at her skill level. Girls who are among the strongest on their team can also excel in leadership skills. The ideal team is one which has no weakest nor strongest player, but where every girl has a role to play and feels important. That's what we strive for at Pumas. </p>

                        <p>Practice times for both the Open and Club division are decided in mid-December after the teams are made. When every team is formed we use the practice availability information that you entered in your registration. We do this so everyone on the team will be able to practice together. We then look to place each team at one of our 7 practice facilities. At this time players may be changed from one team to another (same age and level) to allow all teams to practice together. Once this is finished and double checked we announce the teams practice times on the web site.</p> 

                        <p>Throughout the season your team may have some practice time or location changes due to weather and court availability. Not every facility allows us full access all season.

However, technically you only need to be at one of them. The major disadvantage at missing a tryout date is that we will have incomplete data to use as a comparison with all attendees (at that age group and level). Also, we do not have players tryout outside of their age group if they have a scheduling conflict. This distorts the data collected on that player, as well as any other player they are interacting with. To make the best informed choices we can for our team building we would love to have as much data as possible.

                        <p>There are four primary sets of rules governing indoor volleyball in the USA:
                          <ul>
                            <li>USAV, governing club volleyball including NERVA</li>
                            <li>NCAA, governing college</li>
                            <li>Massachusetts High School Volleyball</li>
                            <li>NFSHSA, ("Federation") governing most high school volleyball outside of Massachusetts</li>
                          </ul>

                        <p>The differences between these four are too numerous to list, but the most common differences are as follows. In NERVA (USAV):
                        <ul>
                          <li>Matches are usually 2 out of 3 games, played to 21 points instead of 3 out of 5 played to 25</li>
                          <li>The Libero cannot be court captain</li>
                          <li>Players cannot completely go over the centerline, even if there was no interference</li>
                          <li>It is allowed to touch the lower part of the net, but not the white tape at the top</li>
                          <li>Timeouts last just 30 seconds, not 60 seconds</li>
                          <li>There is a maximum of 12 substitutions per game instead of 15</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>The 12U division plays with a lighter ball (Tachikara Volley-Lite), a lower net (7'0"), and has special serving rules. If the player misses a serve from the normal end line, she is allowed a second serve from five feet closer to the net. 12U players are generally not asked to referee unless they are comfortable doing so, and the scorekeeping is greatly simplified. All other age groups follow the standard rules. </p>

                        <p>Great question! In order to keep the duration of each tournament to a reasonable time, NERVA plays 21-point games instead of 25-point games. However, because the official USAV rules stipulate 25 as the game-ending score, it was thought better to play the 21 points from 4 to 25 rather than 0 to 21. In this way, a player or coach used to 25-point games could still view 25 as the game-ending score for strategic purposes, and wouldn't be caught by surprise.</p>

                        <p>Different gyms have different rules, and these are reviewed at the coaches meeting before each tournament begins. In most gyms a ball that hits the ceiling but stays on the same side is playable, while a ball that hits the ceiling while crossing the net is out-of-bounds. Balls that hit other obstructions such as basketball backboards are usually a judgment by the referee. If the ball might have been played had the backboard not been there, the referee can signal a play-over. </p>

                        <p>With volleyballs, you generally get what you pay for. For regulation volleyballs, the best balls are made of leather, and these are generally the easiest on the arms. They cost $40-50. Next best is composite leather, which costs $25-35. They are a little harder on the arms but not too bad. We use composite balls for practices and leather balls for games. Most balls you get in backyard volleyball sets or at department stores are either rubber or some amazingly painful material, and will usually discourage the player.</p> 

                        <p>For younger or beginner players, a lighter ball is recommended. The lighter weight makes bumping, setting, and serving easier. We use the white Mikasa Trainer balls or the red, white, and blue Tachikara Volley Lite. They are in the $25-35 range. </p>
