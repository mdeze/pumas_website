          All players will need a USAV membership to participate in the season
          and attend any sessions. This is from the National Governing Body of

            Tryout membership – Cost is $15 and is a limited membership for
            practices only. This membership is good until 12/31/20. You can
            upgrade this to a full membership for an additional $50 and it would
            be good for the rest of the season.
