        <p>Our In-house Skills Program is for those for those players that want to practice but not travel for tournaments. There will be one 6 week session with each practice lasting 2 hours. There are no tryouts for this program and all are welcome. Players on competitive teams, who want to use this opportunity to get more practice time, can register as well. We are limited in court space so registration will be stopped when we are full. Practices will be on Sundays with time and location TBD.</p>
