					<h4>Is This You?</h4>
					<p>We are looking for coaches that are competitive, fun loving, dedicated and want to instill the love of volleyball to girls 9-18 years old. You will teach young athletes all aspects of the game, manage practices and tournaments, strengthen leadership and communication skills, share your skill set with the other coaches, and remember that problems are opportunities for growth.</p>
					<p>Is this you?</p>

				<div class="heading heading-v1 margin-bottom-40">
					<h4>Who We Do This For</h4>
					<p>The athletes that tryout for Pumas teams want to play volleyball, some more competitively than others, but they all love being on a volleyball team together. They want to play, increase their skills and have a coach that is as excited as they are to be there.</p>
					<p>Is this you?</p>
				</div>

				<div class="heading heading-v1 margin-bottom-40">
					<h4>Do You Want To Be Better?</h4>
					<p>Are you interested in increasing your coaching skill set? Whether you are just starting out or have been coaching for 30 years we want coaches that are always looking to improve, expand, and share their skills. We may coach our teams individually but as a club we are strongest when we work together as a team. We all have different experiences that shape us as coaches and people and sharing the knowledge gained from those experiences is what strengthens us.</p>
					<p>Is this you?</p>
				</div>

				<div class="heading heading-v1 margin-bottom-40">
					<h4>Can you do it?</h4>
					<p>You will be asked to take a group of strangers and guide them into becoming a competitive, fun loving, knowledgeable team. This is challenging and may test your limits dealing with unreasonable expectations from players, parents or yourself. However, the pay- off, those aha moments, those everything worked right plays and the look on the players faces when it happens are (as the commercials say) Priceless!!!</p>
					<p>Is this you?</p>
				</div>

				<div class="heading heading-v1 margin-bottom-40">
					<h4>Do you believe?</h4>
					<p>While competitive, we do not place winning above teaching the players to love the game, respect their teammates, the officials and themselves. We are a multi goal oriented club that looks at the team and the individual as a whole â€“ not a means to an end (the win.</p>
					<p>Is this you?</p>
				</div>

				<div class="tag-box tag-box-v2 box-shadow shadow-effect-1">
					<p>We are building a team of coaches that have vision, motivation, joy, optimism, dedication, are givers, and are constantly pushing themselves to understand the changes the team and the individual athletes will go through.</p>
					<h2 class="text-center">If this is you, we would love for you to join us!</h2>

The best way to teach teamwork and respect to our athletes is for our coaches to demonstrate and live that teamwork at all times. Leadership is an elusive trait that manifests itself differently within different coaches. Some coaches are successful emotional leaders, others are quiet leaders, some coach's lead by being the hardest workers and some just naturally engender respect by their nature and demeanor.</p>
