      <p><em>"A common concern every year is the cost of fees. The fees for both the Open and Club divisions are comparable to other clubs. Fees are raised to keep pace with our court costs, tournament fees, uniforms and coach retention. We are a non-profit and only raise fees to the amounts needed to run our programs.</em></p>
        
      <p><em>One of our hallmarks at Pumas are the <strong>six extra practice dates</strong> that almost no other club has because they hold practice on Sunday (These practices are missed due to Sunday NERVA tournaments and Easter) and Pumas practice on Saturday. Starting this year, we have <strong>approximately 42 hours of additional practice</strong> with the addition of a second practice (Tuesday) for all teams. In addition, all local multi-day tournaments (Winterfest, Qualifiers, Boston, Rhode Island Rumble) are also included in the season fee.</em></p> 
        
      <p><em>We hope you will stay with Pumas as we continue to improve our programs and give your daughters an experience they will both enjoy and benefit from."</em></p>
