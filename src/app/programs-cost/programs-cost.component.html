      <p><em>"A common concern every year is the cost of fees. The fees for both the Open and Club divisions are comparable to other clubs. Fees are raised to keep pace with our court costs, tournament fees, uniforms and coach retention. We are a non-profit and only raise fees to the amounts needed to run our programs. One of our hallmarks at Pumas are the five extra practice dates that almost no other club has because they practice on Sunday (They miss practice because of the NERVA tournaments). We hope you will stay with Pumas as we continue to improve our programs and give your daughters an experience they will both enjoy and benefit from."</em></p>
