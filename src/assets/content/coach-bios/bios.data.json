My big opportunity to really learn volleyball came in 1986 when a group of Wallyball friends were asked to scrimmage a women’s adult volleyball team that was being coached. After that initial scrimmage I went to every practice after that to just help the team and learn the game.</p><p>Coaching has been one of my passions, and a second career, since 1983. I began coaching for Pumas Volleyball Club (formally Andover Volleyball Club) in 2006 and have coached 14’s, 16’s and 18’s (mostly at the open level). I am constantly striving to improve my coaching and administrative skills to make the team experience more enjoyable and beneficial. I want to instill a love of the game, a desire to give your best effort for every point and the knowledge on how to pass that on to the next group of young athletes.  There have been approximately 10-12 former Pumas players that have finished college and have come back to coach volleyball either at Pumas or other clubs.</p><p>   I have worked fulltime as a Fire Fighter and EMT since 1987 and have been a practicing Personal Trainer, First Aid Instructor and CPR Instructor for 20+ years. My current position is as a Fire Lieutenant (2004) of Tower Ladder 2.  I have a BS in Sports + Fitness from Salem State College and a Master’s in Education from Merrimack College.</p><p>As a competitive athlete I had the privilege of competing in athletic contests and meeting athletes from around the world (Portugal, Australia, and New Zealand) and across the country (California, Nevada, New York, Wisconsin, Tennessee, and all New England). Sports competed in include Decathlon, Triathlon, Cross Country, Road Racing, Track + Field, Wallyball, Beach Volleyball and Indoor Volleyball.

This is a cornerstone of my work with players, as well as my drive to improve as a coach.</p><p>I started playing intramural volleyball in college and got hooked. When I got out of college, I found one avenue after another to continue to grow and learn as a player, making friends with teammates and opponents alike along the way. It was a great way to stay active and meet a lot of great people.</p><p>I got into coaching when I ran into a former teammate at work, he told me about the North Andover Boosters Club. That led to learning about and getting involved in Pumas Volleyball Club. I found out about an opening for a Freshman Coach at Salem, NH through a former Pumas coach; and subsequently was recommended to apply for the Wilmington High School Varsity job through another Pumas coach.As part of my drive to become a better coach. I have completed or am currently working towards the following certifications from USA Volleyball:<ul><li>IMPACT – Increased Mastery and Professional Application of Coaching Theory</li><li>CAP I – Coaching Accreditation Program – Level I</li><li>CAP II – Coaching Accreditation Program – Level II</li></ul></p><h3 class='text-center'>Emerald 16U Open at NERVA III</h3><p><img class='img-responsive center-block' src='/assets/img/photo-gallery/on-the-court/2017/Emerald-NERVA-III-Chill.jpg' width='400' height='300' alt=''></p><p>In addition, I am a member of the following coaching organizations, have access to materials from, or have attended coaching clinics with the following organizations:<ul><li>AVCA – American Volleyball Coaches Association – member</li><li>Gold Medal Squared – attended coaching clinic</li><li>Art of Coaching Volleyball – access to their extensive web site (provided by Pumas)</li></ul></p><p>Since one of the major responsibilities of a coach is to provide a safe environment for our players, I also have the following certifications:<ul><li>Red Cross CPR and First Aid</li><li>Concussion in Sports</li><li>SafeSport (provide an environment free from misconduct in sports) </li></ul></p><p>My involvement in volleyball is not limited to coaching. I also have the following experience in the sport:<ul><li>Former Commissioner for North Andover Boosters Club Girls Volleyball</li><li>Current member of Board of Directors of Pumas Volleyball Club</li><li>Co-Owner of Volleyball MD</li></ul></p><p>I have a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Engineering (Course 6-3) from MIT, and support my family and my coaching habit by working full time as a Supply Chain Engineer at a company that builds medical products. My technical background has been important in learning to make use of statistics in a way that can help my players understand the difference that their performance in one or more areas can make in the team’s overall performance and outcomes.</p><p>In the future, I would like to see expanded opportunities for people to continue to play volleyball both indoors and outdoors. I would like to see expanded Rec League play available for both youth and adults as a way for people to learn about and enjoy competitive volleyball.</p>"

That year I became an assistant coach on the 15s Open team, Magenta. I’ve been with Pumas ever since and have since gotten involved with VolleyballMD and their offseason clinics. I started coaching for the North Andover Boosters Program my second year with Pumas as if I didn’t spend enough time on the court.</p><p>I graduated North Andover High School and graduated with my Bachelors of Science in Elementary Education from Boston University (Go Terriers!). When I am not on the court, I work as an Intellectual Property Project Manager at an online textbook company in Boston. I’ve been keeping 3rd party permissions cleared on budget and on time since 2013. As a project manager, I have learned time management, clear communication, and organization. Coaching and project management complement each other splendidly. I feel like I wouldn’t be where I am in one job without having the experience of the other.</p><p>See you on the court!</p>"
