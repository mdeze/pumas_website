I have been coaching virtually nonstop since 1983 and have coached Volleyball, Cross Country, Track + Field, Triathlons and Decathlons at the Junior High, High School, Collegiate and Adult level. As a coach I strive to help the athlete discover and develop their complete athletic ability. The success of the athlete, especially in the school age years, is in more than the wins and losses they compile. This includes teaching the athlete about nutrition, balancing lifeâ€™s demands with the sports demands, integration of body and mind, visualization, goal setting, goal attainment, time management, strength of character, increasing self-esteem, leadership development and many other skills that can serve the athlete in their sport as well as their non-athletic life</p><p>Coaching has been one of my passions, and a second career, since 1983. I am constantly striving to improve my coaching and administrative skills to make the team experience more enjoyable and beneficial. I want to instill a love of the game, a desire to give your best effort for every point and the knowledge on how to pass that on to the next group of young athletes.</p>"
