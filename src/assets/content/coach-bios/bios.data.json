My big opportunity to really learn volleyball came in 1986 when a group of Wallyball friends were asked to scrimmage a women’s adult volleyball team that was being coached. After that initial scrimmage I went to every practice after that to just help the team and learn the game.</p><p>Coaching has been one of my passions, and a second career, since 1983. I began coaching for Pumas Volleyball Club (formally Andover Volleyball Club) in 2006 and have coached 14’s, 16’s and 18’s (mostly at the open level). I am constantly striving to improve my coaching and administrative skills to make the team experience more enjoyable and beneficial. I want to instill a love of the game, a desire to give your best effort for every point and the knowledge on how to pass that on to the next group of young athletes.  There have been approximately 10-12 former Pumas players that have finished college and have come back to coach volleyball either at Pumas or other clubs.</p><p>   I have worked fulltime as a Fire Fighter and EMT since 1987 and have been a practicing Personal Trainer, First Aid Instructor and CPR Instructor for 20+ years. My current position is as a Fire Lieutenant (2004) of Tower Ladder 2.  I have a BS in Sports + Fitness from Salem State College and a Master’s in Education from Merrimack College.</p><p>As a competitive athlete I had the privilege of competing in athletic contests and meeting athletes from around the world (Portugal, Australia, and New Zealand) and across the country (California, Nevada, New York, Wisconsin, Tennessee, and all New England).

Highlights include:<ul><li>Competing in Volleyball demonstrations in Portugal versus their semi-pro teams</li><li>2001 Adult Volleyball Nationals second place finish and voted to All Tournament Team</li><li>First Place finishes in World Fire Fighter Games and World Police and Fire Games in the Decathlon.</li><li>Fourth place finish in the New England D3 Decathlon Championships (1991)</li><li>HS All Star in track and Cross country</li></ul></p><p></p>"

When I got out of college, I found one avenue after another to continue to grow and learn as a player, making friends with teammates and opponents alike along the way. It was a great way to stay active and meet a lot of great people.</p><p>I got into coaching when I ran into a former teammate at work, he told me about the North Andover Boosters Club. That led to learning about and getting involved in Pumas Volleyball Club. I found out about an opening for a Freshman Coach at Salem, NH through a former Pumas coach; and subsequently was recommended to apply for the Wilmington High School Varsity job through another Pumas coach.As part of my drive to become a better coach. I have completed or am currently working towards the following certifications from USA Volleyball:<ul><li>IMPACT – Increased Mastery and Professional Application of Coaching Theory</li><li>CAP I – Coaching Accreditation Program – Level I</li><li>CAP II – Coaching Accreditation Program – Level II</li></ul></p><p></p><p></p>"
